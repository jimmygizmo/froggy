type: menu
title: Animals - Animals, Insects & Other Non-Plant Organisms
sort: 010
# The sort: field will be used for alphanumeric ascending sorting of the dirs/nav-menu entries.
#   Put any keys you want here and lower sorting like 001 or AAA or aaa or 0a1 etc will sort first (to the top/left).
#   Set this in some or all of your menu.yaml AND/OR item.yaml files and you can acheive any sort order you like
#   and you can develop your own convention as it is flexible, general alphanumeric.
#   TODO: Make it so if there is no sort: key at all then the entry will default to sorting LAST. Much better for users.
