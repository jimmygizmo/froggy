# About the /catalogs/world/common/ or /input/common/ directory:

Shared images such as logos, template images or images used on more than one node, go in here.

Do not modify anyhting inside /catalogs/world/ as it should be kept here for reference.
Do your work inside /input/ and use /catalogs/world/ as your example.

NOTE: The .gitignore in this project will prevent any of your work you do inside /input/ from being added to
your clone of the Froggy repo. You can of course change any of this to suit your needs.

(The presence of this about file in the repository also serves to keep this important directory in the repo.)
