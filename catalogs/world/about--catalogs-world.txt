# About the /catalogs/world/ directory:

"World" is an entire input structure or 'catalog' included for documentation purposes as an example.

In general about catalogs in Froggy:

Any directory inside /catalogs/ is an entire input directory structure/hierarchy with all the YAML and other input
files and directories. It is like the default input directory /input/ within the project root.

Catalogs (directory structures within the top level of the /catalogs/ directory) are easily-selectable alternative
input structures.

Froggy will use the input structure you select with the --catalog option, or Froggy will default to the /input/
input structure.

An input structure, either the default one or one inside of /catalogs/, is all all of your source content and
YAML data, in a structure arallel to that of your desired output structure under the /output/ directory.


(The presence of this about file in the repository also serves to keep this important directory in the repo.)
