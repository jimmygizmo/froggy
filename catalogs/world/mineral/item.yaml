title: Bar of Gold - Inorganic Things in The World (Mineral, Not Plant Nor Animal)
description: >
  This is a beautiful bar of gold and it is not an animal and it is not a plant. One might expect a menu at this node,
  but no, this is an item type of node and in this world, there is only one in-organic object, this gold bar.
  In this example catalog 'The World' this node is here to show an item node at the second level, thats all. The
  root of the structure is the first level. At least this is my convention with Froggy for the time being. I will
  confirm what graph theory calls the levels and get in sync with that, most likely. This is after all at its core,
  graph traversal, specifically DAGs.
