  This is a Tree with a trunk, branches and leaves. Froggy item nodes are sort of like leaves on a tree. Froggy
  menu nodes are sort of like the places in a tree where two or more branches come together. Menu nodes, like on
  trees, are branching points and have only one parent node, but can have many child nodes. The parent node will
  always be a menu node, but any of the other 'branches' can be either menu or item nodes. Remember the item nodes
  are like leaves and in this way, the Froggy input structure is exactly like a real tree. Tree Frogs are really
  excellent climbers by the way and are experts at navigating trees; hence the name Froggy.
