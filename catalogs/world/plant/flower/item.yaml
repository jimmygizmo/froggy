  Flowers are not trees but tree frogs can climb flowers as well as they climb trees. Trees smell really nice but
  some flowers can smell especially wonderful. A big bonus you get from beautiful looking and smelling flowers is
  that all the bugs and frogs and lizards love the flowers too, so the more flowers you grow, the more of a little
  nature festival you will have in your yard and your garden. This is an item node, so it is for a specific plant
  and a specific flower so this will be a Geranium. Geraniums smell wonderful, are easy to grow, come in many colors,
  are drought tolerant, and bloom very often throughout the year. Watch out though because sometimes squirrels will
  eat large parts of your Geranium plants and deer and many other creatures will eat your Geranium flowers, but since
  they bloom so often, you can have fresh flowers the next day .. but the hungry deer will be back the next day too!
