<!-- Drop-In CSS Style Switcher - Adds a pulldown menu at page top to try out styles. Get the link after choosing. -->
<!-- Not all the styles/themes provide a simple link. You have to look at the GitHub or website for each one. -->

ADD THIS SCRIPT TAG (and enable it) TO ADD THE STYLE/THEME SAMPLER PULLDOWN. ADD IT TO THE VERY TOP OF THE BODY.

<!-- <script src="https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css/switcher.js" type="text/javascript"></script> -->

BASICALLY YOU ENABLE THE PULLDOWN FOR A WHILE AND TRY OUT THE THEMES.
Some of the have links, some don't. I'm only advising on the quick/easy method at the moment and that is you
will need to read the website and/or the GitHub page or the docs for any style you like. Then hope for a single
third-party-hosted stylesheet link you can add to your HEAD section.

Later versions of Froggy may support more complex style installs/setups, and it is simple enough to customize this
aspect with small modifications to Froggy Python code and your Jinja2 templates.
