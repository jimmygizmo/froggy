I might use Conda to install some modules into an existing Virtual Env, but I create and manage all my Python V.E.s
using Pyenv. (Disable auto-activation in Conda and then you can use Conda only for installs and use PyEnv for creation
and management.) I do not recommend using Conda to manage your V. Envs. Only use Conda for installs and use PyEnv for everything else.
