# About the /output/common/ directory:

Shared images such as logos, template images or images used on more than one node, will be output here.

Your contant may have images that belong to specifc nodes and those will stay inside the directory of that node,
when processing creates your /output/ structure. However there are images that go with your templates as well as
images that you might use on more than one node. Such 'shared' images which are not strictly specific to one node,
must go in /input/common/

In the generated site/structure, such 'shared' images will be in /output/common/
Links to them and/or <img> tags for them etc will be handled appropriately based on the options used.

There will be no index.yaml file in either the /input/common/ or the /output/common/ directory as there is no
YAML parsing for these directories. They only hold resource files like images which are shared. There is no
navigable html page generated for the /common/ directory, which is what the YAML parsing does.

(The presence of this about file in the repository also serves to keep this important directory in the repo.)
