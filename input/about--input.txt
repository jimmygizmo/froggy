about--input.txt

# About the /input/ directory:

The entire structure underneath the /input/ directory is all of your source content and YAML data, in a structure
parallel to that of your desired output structure under the /output/ directory.

(The presence of this about file in the repository also serves to keep this important directory in the repo.)
